    </p>
    <div>
    	<ul>
    		<li class="topline">Be friendly and welcoming</li>
    		<li>Be patient Remember that people have varying communication styles
                and that not everyone is using their native language. (Meaning and tone
                can be lost in translation.)</li>
            <li>Being thoughtful Productive communication requires effort. Think about
                how your words will be interpreted.</li>
            <li>Remember that sometimes it is best to refrain entirely from commenting.</li>
            <li>Be respectful In particular, respect differences of opinion.</li>
            <li>Be charitable: Interpret the arguments of others in good faith, do not seek to      disagree.</li>
            <li>When we do disagree, try to understand why.</li>
            <li>Avoid destructive behavior: Derailing: stay on topic; if you want to talk about something else, start a new conversation.</li>
            <li>Unconstructive criticism: don’t merely decry the current state of affairs; offer—or at least solicit—suggestions as to how things may be improved.</li>
            <li>Snarking (pithy, unproductive, sniping comments)</li>
            <li>Discussing potentially offensive or sensitive issues; this all too often leads to unnecessary conflict.</li>
            <li>Microaggressions: brief and commonplace verbal, behavioral and environmental indignities that communicate hostile, derogatory or negative slights and insults to a person or group</li>
            <li>Be mindful of your language. Any of the following behavior is unacceptable</li>
            <li>Offensive comments related to gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, language, neuro-type, size, ability, class, religion, culture, subculture, political opinion, age, skill level, occupation, or background</li>
            <li>Threats of violence</li>
            <li>Deliberate intimidation.</li>
            <li>Sexually explicit or violent material</li>
            <li>Unwelcome sexual attention</li>
            <li>Stalking or following</li>
            <li>Or any other kinds of harassment</li>
